# 🐍 Data Cleaning & Analysis (Python Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves data cleaning and transformation using Python. The source dataset was in CSV format. The script performs table joining, missing value handling (zero replacement), and average calculation to prepare the data for analysis.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

## 🔧 Key Steps Performed
- Imported CSV file and explored the dataset
- Replaced all 0s with a fixed value where appropriate
- Joined multiple tables using `pandas.merge()` based on a common key
- Calculated average of selected columns post-cleaning
- Exported the final clean dataset

## 💡 Learning Outcome
Demonstrated data preprocessing and transformation techniques using Python. Built confidence in working with raw CSV files and preparing clean datasets ready for business analysis.

## 📎 Files Included
- `cleaning_script.py` – Python logic  
- `sales_data.csv` – Sample raw data  
- `cleaned_data.csv` – Clean output (optional)

## 📈 Output
Cleaned, joined dataset with accurate averages and no missing or misleading values.
